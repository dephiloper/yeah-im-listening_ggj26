It’s so nice to finally meet you!
I’m wondering if I should get something to eat with my coffee.
Those chocolate chip cookies looked really good.
What kind of food do you like?
[?] Anything spicy
	Oh I see.
	One of those who lives life on the edge huh?
[?] Simple hearty things
	Same here! Those are the best!
[?] I'm not much of a foodie
	That's a shame.
    Maybe I can find something you like.
This is one of my favourite places around here, it’s so cozy.
Oh guess what, on my way here I saw two pidgeons fighting over a falafel roll.
It was hilarious! 
So, I’ve been working very hard on my music lately.
Just formed a new band, it’s called ‘The Maskers’.
It’s a combination of edgy punk rock and minimal techno.
We’re releasing our first single next Friday.
Want to come to the release show?
[?] Yes, I'd love to!
	That's amazing! I'll put you on the list right away.
	You won't regret it, it's going to be epic!
[?] When is it again?
	We're playing at Mercury Club, showtime is at 11.
	It's next Friday, don't forget!
[?] I'm not sure...
	Oh come on, it'll be fun!
	Just think about it, okay?
It would mean a lot to me if you were there!
I mean it’s our first show with the new band. 
I might actually need some help with finding a cool outfit for the gig.
Do you have any idea where I could find something?
Preferably second hand.
Should I wear some kind of a mask?
That could be really cool or what do you think?
