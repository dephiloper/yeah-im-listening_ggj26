It’s so nice to finally meet you!
I’m wondering if I should get something to eat with my coffee.
Those chocolate chip cookies looked really good.
This is one of my favourite places around here, it’s so cozy.
Oh guess what, on my way here I saw two pidgeons fighting over a falafel roll.
It was hilarious! 
So, I’ve been working very hard on my music lately.
Just formed a new band, it’s called ‘The Maskers’.
It’s a combination of edgy punk rock and minimal techno.
We’re releasing our first single next Friday.
Want to come to the release show?
I can get you on the list. We’re playing at Mercury Club, showtime is at 11.
It would mean a lot to me if you were there!
I mean it’s our first show with the new band. 
I might actually need some help with finding a cool outfit for the gig.
Do you have any idea where I could find something?
Preferably second hand.
Should I wear some kind of a mask?
That could be really cool or what do you think?
