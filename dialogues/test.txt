[?] Hey, how are you doing?
[?] How are things?
Good, thank you!
This is one of my favourite places around here, it’s so cozy. 
Have you been here before?
[?] Yes this is one of my favourites too!#correct
	Really? That’s great!
[?] Yeah once, and you?
	Yeah all the time, as it is one of my favourites.	
[?] …
	Umm never mind…
So, I’ve been working very hard on my music lately. 
Just formed a new band, it’s called ‘The Maskers’. 
It’s a combination of edgy punk rock and minimal techno. 
What kind of music do you like?
[?] I’m into many genres but punk is my favourite.#correct
	Cool, I really think you should check The Maskers out.
	We’re actually releasing our first single next Friday.	
[?] I mostly listen to folk music. 
	Oh we have quite different musical preferences.
	But if you’d like to try something new, we’re releasing our first single next Friday.
[?] …
	… anyway we’re releasing our first single next Friday.
We’re having a release show at Mercury Club.
Would you like to come?
[?] I’d love to! What time is it?#correct
	Great, I can get you on the guest list. We’re playing at 11.
[?] I’d love to! Where is it?
	Like I said, it’s at Mercury Club…
[?] …
	Hello…
It would mean a lot to me if you were there! 
I mean it’s our first show with the new band. 
I might actually need some help with finding a cool outfit for the gig. 
Preferably second hand. 
Would you like to help me find something?
[?] Sure, there’s a shopping mall at the corner.
	Hmm it’s not second hand though…
[?] There’s a Vintage Store at my neighbourhood. I can take you there.#correct
	Sounds great, thank you!
[?] …
